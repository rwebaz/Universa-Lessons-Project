## Born First

{{ page.description}}

Although the two platforms (UTN) and (XRP) are similar in their pursuit of transactions to bind into blocks, subtle differences in their competing structures afford a closer look.

(XRP) was born first in the year #2013 and had a *breakout* year in #2017 forging ahead in price from less than 1 penny USD to over $2.00 USD by the end of #2017.

**Caution.** There are a *triple-ton* of (XRP) unleashed on the market with no other suspect reason than to provide speculative liquidity for those that wish to participate in the Internet of blockchains without writing a stitch of code.

In the process, both the old CEO of Ripple and the new CEO of ripple have reaped *ginormous* gains in wealth from their enormous holdings of (XRP) captured in the PRE-SALE market.

## Do the Math

Still doing the math reveals an investment of $10,000 on January 1st, #2017 would have created a portfolio of one-million (1,000,000) **XRP** at a cost of 1 penny USD per coin, as follows:

```liquid
{% raw %}
$10,000 USD / $0.01 USD = 1,000,000 XRP
{% endraw %}
```

And, that's another $2 million USD in market value at the close of $2017.
