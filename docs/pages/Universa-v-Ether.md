# Universa v Ether

The two forms of *ether* that are used to drive the **Smart Contracts** over at the **Ethereum Network** are:

1. **ETH** = Ethereum, and,

1. **ETC** = Ethereum Classic.

## Universa

The atomic bit used in the **Universa** network is called a ( UTN ).

The *par value* of (1) bit of **UTN** = $0.01 USD ( one US penny ).

**Note**. The smallest *byte* in the Bitcoin network ( BTC ) is called a "Satoshi".

Here, (1) **UTN** *bit* is divisible by (18) decimal places, or "bytes".

For example, 1,000 UTN are equal to $10 USD ( .01 x 1,000 = 10 ) called a "kUTN" or *kilo*.

Whereas, 1,000,000 "uUtn" are equal to 1 millionth of a US penny ( .01/1,000,000 = 0.000001 ) called a "uUTN" or "huelo".

The Universa Foundation has authorized the sale of 1B UTN prior to 10-28-2017 at (1) penny USD plus a 20% bonus.

After 10-28-2017 kilos may be purchased at the then prevailing rate up to a limit of $99 million USD.

## Smart Contract Chain(s)

The **Universa** platform will allow a tree of *smart contracts* to create a **Smart Contract Chain**.

## Mining

- Teaching a neural network to mine

- More to come

## Crypto Attributes

As reported by **Coin Desk**, the following *Crypto attributes* are essential ...

- Core development team

- Brilliant track record

- Financial privacy

## Smart Contracts

A **Smart Contract** is simply a set of **Turing Complete** script data stored in a tree structure that can be executed universally across a platform.

**Note**. The weight of a **Smart Contract** over the **Universa** platform cannot exceed (1) Giga-byte of size.

- (1) GB = 1,024 MB of data

### Script Data

**Question**. How is script data stored in tree structures?

**Answer**: Key-value pairs in Merkle trees aka "databases on crypto steroids"

**Question**. What type(s) of script data can be stored in tree structures?

- Fixed values

- Binary executable logic

- Dynamically executing scripts ( including structures of complex nesting representations )

- Pointers to other trees on the network

- Pointers to other *Addresses* on the network

## The Blockchain

Under the **Universa** umbrella, the **Blockchain** merely records the current *state* of the underlying **Smart Contract**. The body, or *corpus* of the **Smart Contract** remains stored in a *crypto cloud*, or *flash drive*.

## Notary Cloud

When a **Smart Contract** hits the **Universa** network, a *time stamp* is issued by the **Universa** *Notary Cloud*.

### Markers

Old states of smart contracts may be stored for (2) years in the **Universa** *Notary Cloud* via a separate smart contract called a *marker*.

### Nodes

- The structure of the **Universa** network is stored in many Trusted *nodes* of equal host.

Whereas, the **Notary Cloud** runs on a separate Unix server that contains the primary, dynamic copy of the ledger, *Universa Nodes* are alerted instantaneously of new, entering **Smart Contracts** and as a consequence the structure of the entire network may change as a result at any given fraction of a second, or *nanosecond*.

## Token Distribution

- 2/3 rd's of the entire float of *UNI* coins are in the hands of the public.

- 10% of the entire float is reserved for the development team

- The **Universa Foundation** holds 20% of the entire float

- The remaining 4% is reserved for partnership, bounty provisions, and advisors

## Securities Act of 1933

The **Securities Act of 1933** prohibits even the offer, as well as the sale ... If an underlying *security*, if defined as such, is unregistered or non-exempt.

**Note**. The **Securities Act of 1933** does not specifically define an **Investment Contract** aka *Security*.

### The Test of Security

- Is it an offer?

- Is it a contract?

- Is it a scheme?

#### SEC v The Howey Co

- 328 U.S. 293 (1946)

In the US Supreme Court case of the SEC versus the Howey Company heard in May of '46 ...

Several testing mechanisms for the term *security* were elucidated by the court, as follows:

- Is there an underlying investment contract?

- Is there a separate service contract attached to the offer?

- Does the marketing scheme involve an investment of money?

- Is the investment of money directed towards a common enterprise?

- Are the profits ( or, losses ) of the investment expected to come about solely from the efforts of others, other than the investor?

- For example, are the profits ( or, losses ) of the investment to come about solely from the promoter's efforts, or from the efforts of a 3rd party?

- Is the subject enterprise a *speculative* enterprise ( immaterial )

- Are the shares in the enterprise evidenced or referenced by formal certificates ( immaterial )

- Are the shares in the enterprise evidenced or referenced by nominal interests in the physical assets employed in the subject enterprise ( immaterial )

- Is there a sale of property with or without intrinsic value included in the proposed *security* ( immaterial )

- Is the broad protection of investors thwarted by unrealistic or irrelevant formulae as a result of the "maybe-an-offer"?

- Are the Respondents using the US Mail system, or some other instrumentalities of interstate commerce ie.) the Internet, to propagate the "maybe-an-offer"?

- Is the purported "maybe-an-offer" sufficiently vague to be considered NOT an offer?

- Is there a date or time stamp emblazoned on the "maybe-an-offer"?

- Is the meaning of the date or time stamp sufficiently known, or inferred to be known by a majority of the targeted class of persons?

- The targeted class of persons are those individuals currently registered with the Venmo service as opposed to those who are expected to be enticed by the "maybe-an-offer" sufficiently to the point of seduction or inducement into registering with the Venmo service.

- Will those individuals of either class of targeted persons then as a result transfer $5 cash from their Venmo accounts to the Venmo address of @Rwebaz?

- Will those same individuals of either class of targeted persons who have transferred $5 cash from their Venmo accounts to the Venmo address of @Rwebaz then as a result be eligible to receive a return gift of (6) as yet undefined coins?

- Is the return award of "(6) coins" sufficiently broad to escape the registration provisions of the **Securities Act of 1933**?

- Which crypto currency shall the (6) coins be denominated in?

- Will the digital "hard" wallet of the individual accept the type of coin denominated?

- Do the targeted sets of classes of individuals all currently possess digital "hard" wallets?

- Is there a unilateral offer to purchase proprietary digital "hard" wallets implicitly embedded in the underlying "maybe-an-offer" of the $5 transfer, if indeed determined to be an actual "offer" subject to the registration provisions of the **Securities Act of 1933**?

### Registration Requirements

See: 328 U.S. 294 - 297 and 328 U.S. 299

## Analysis

**UTN** may lack the status of a legal tender, but nevertheless still retains the utility of a legal tender.

If that is clearly the object envinced, then the offer may be subject to the registration requirements of the **Securities Act of 1933**.

If on the other hand, the prototypically targeted "maybe-an-offer" is sufficiently vague, then not.

## Conclusion

The above discussed "maybe-an-offer" does not fall within the penumbra of the **Securities Act of 1933**.
